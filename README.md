# Axis v1

Axis is a signal-first coaching OS.

It turns:

- environments into behavior
- behavior into data
- data into adaptive constraints

This repo is the first live node of Axis:

- React + Vite frontend
- Supabase backend
- Live session state + operator input (in progress)

Status: v1 scaffold live. Supabase connected.
